Add simple virtual storage

# How to use
You can open the storage at `/stackstorage` or `/st`

# Feature
Use the familiar chest gui that opens the most while playing with Minecraft to get items in and out infinitely
Enchantments and durability can also be saved

If you put more than 64 pieces of one item, only 64 pieces will be displayed in the storage, but the amount currently stored in the storage is written in the item description field.
The description field will be automatically deleted when the player puts it in the inventory, so it will not interfere

# Permission
`stackstorage.command`  
Permission to open storage by command  
Default can be used by anyone
